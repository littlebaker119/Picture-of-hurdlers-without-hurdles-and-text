	   This is a website I have made, on this day, at this time, at this place, in this spot, in this chair, in a room, in a building, in a city, in a state, in a nation, in a continent, in a world, in a solar system, in a galaxy, in a thing. If this were a graph with 4 dimensions with the coordinate system (x,y,z,t), it would be (0,0,0,0) and ever point in space and time afterwards would be dynamic.
	So I can do a thing with the internet.
